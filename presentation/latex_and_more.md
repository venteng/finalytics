# Latex and more

## General comments

1. 中英文需要一致，不能各寫各。 
2. A paragraph will include 5 to 10 lines. Too big paragraph makes me dizzy. 
3. Include url for dataset if possible
4. Switch to NYCU template, because Thesis uses chapters but not just sections. But do not use logo's, Chinese, stuffs like that, at this moment. Just use English. Thesis template can be found for example in [an overleaf template found by Ian](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/national-yang-ming-chiao-tung-university-nycu-thesis-template/zgjfrxhcdcmj?fbclid=IwAR3OUXIOJ7jLGLMquRjJeLE_Ml2lYlgWyEoDCra9YacgAwyql4_R0VbrO-I). 

## Latex

1. For each chapter or section titles, add a label \\label{sec:xxxxx}. Need to introduce how you organize a chapterat the beginning of each chapter before the first section. 
2. Add sections for "Chapter 2: Literature Review". 
3. It will be easier for me to trace the materials with the following lable rules
    - lables for figure \ref{fig:xxx}
    - lables for table \ref{tab:xxx}
    - lables for equation \ref{eq:x}
    - lables for section or subsections \ref{sec:xxx}
4. Tables and Figures will be in the middle of the context (not the end of the thesis)
5. For all captions, only the first letter is in upper case, but all the others are in lower case. 
6. Minor deatils
    - Expectation: `$\mbox{\sf E}$` (or better one)
    - Transpose: `$\top$ `
    - formulas $\rightarrow$ formulae
    - $\left[\{(\cdot)\}\right]$
